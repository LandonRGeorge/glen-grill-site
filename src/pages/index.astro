        <h2 class="section__header">The Art of Custom Grilling</h2>
        <div class="section__content">
          <p>Every grill we create begins with a conversation about your vision. Whether you're dreaming of a sleek
            modern
            centerpiece for your contemporary patio or a robust, traditional setup for serious barbecue enthusiasts, our
            master craftsmen translate your ideas into reality using only the finest materials.</p>
        </div>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Premium Materials, Lasting Performance</h2>
        <div>
          <p>We source precision-engineered components that stand up to
            years of intense heat and regular use. Our grills aren't just built to look impressive – they're engineered
            to
            deliver consistent, restaurant-quality results every time you fire them up. Our grills are built with a
            solid 1/8 thick frame for cooking and stability. </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Tailored to Your Space and Style</h2>
        <p>No two outdoor kitchens are alike, and neither should be their grills. We design each piece to complement
          your existing architecture, fit your available space perfectly, and match your entertaining style. From
          compact urban balcony solutions to sprawling outdoor kitchen installations, we make it work.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Beyond the Ordinary Grilling Experience</h2>
        <p>Our custom approach means incorporating features that matter to you: specialized cooking zones for different
          techniques, built-in temperature monitoring, custom storage solutions, or integrated prep areas. We're not
          just
          building a grill – we're creating the foundation for countless memorable meals.</p>

        <h2>Your Vision, Our Expertise</h2>
        <p>
          With decades of metalworking experience and a passion for outdoor cooking, our team brings both technical
          skill
          and culinary understanding to every project. We guide you through material choices, design options, and
          functionality features to ensure your finished grill exceeds your expectations.

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>From initial consultation through final installation, we maintain open communication and meticulous
          attention to
          detail. Each grill is handcrafted in our workshop, thoroughly tested, and professionally installed to ensure
          years of reliable performance and cooking satisfaction.
