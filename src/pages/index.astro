        <div class="section__content">
          <p>Every grill we create begins with a conversation about your vision. Whether you're dreaming of a sleek modern
            centerpiece for your contemporary patio or a robust, traditional setup for serious barbecue enthusiasts, our
            master craftsmen translate your ideas into reality using only the finest materials.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Premium Materials, Lasting Performance</h2>
        <div class="section__content">
        <p>We source heavy-gauge stainless steel, cast iron grates, and precision-engineered components that stand up to
          years of intense heat and regular use. Our grills aren't just built to look impressive – they're engineered to
          deliver consistent, restaurant-quality results every time you fire them up.</p>

        <h2>Tailored to Your Space and Style</h2>
        <p>No two outdoor kitchens are alike, and neither should be their grills. We design each piece to complement
          your existing architecture, fit your available space perfectly, and match your entertaining style. From
          compact urban balcony solutions to sprawling outdoor kitchen installations, we make it work.</p>

        <h2>Beyond the Ordinary Grilling Experience</h2>
        <p>Our custom approach means incorporating features that matter to you: specialized cooking zones for different
          techniques, built-in temperature monitoring, custom storage solutions, or integrated prep areas. We're not
          just
          building a grill – we're creating the foundation for countless memorable meals.</p>

          skill
